TUV 5.2.1 for DSMACC
====================
This is an updated TUV 5.2 version with additional photoreactions for the use with the DSMACC model version available at https://github.com/pb866/DSMACC-testing.git. TUV 5.2.1 is designed for a new GECKO-A/MCM photolysis protocol, which will become available soon.

Getting started

- Download/clone [DSMACC](https://github.com/pb866/DSMACC-testing.git).
- Initialise TUV as DSMACC git submodule and compile TUV from the DSMACC main folder by running the DSMACC make command `make new`
