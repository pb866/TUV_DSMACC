FIXES/GENERAL UPDATES:
======================

• qys.f, SR qyacet, l. 73: changed 'w .LT. 327.' to 'w .LE. 327.'
  (wavelength 327 has never been calculated)
• in rdinp.f, ll. 128 - 133: '(1:1)' removed from 'inpfil(1:1)'
  to allow to load file names starting with 1 - 5
• in rdinp.f, l. 286: '(1:1)' removed from 'savfil(1:1)'
  to allow output files starting with 1
• Label in error message for quantum yield interpolation corrected
  (from j-1 to j) for second CH2O channel; SR pxCH2O, l. 13114 in original rxn.f
  and from j to j-1 for first channel in obsolete r10, l. 2367/2427 in original rxn.f
• wrong absorption cross section for MEK from data by Martinez et al. read in by TUV!
  Corrected to read 3rd col. (MEK) instead of fourth column (propyl methyl ketone)
• in savout.f, l. 165/631 (SR outpt1/outpt2):
  correct outfil from character*20 to character*6
• clearance of unused variables
• conversion of tabs into spaces
• corrections of number types (assigning decimal points to all floats)
• grids.f, SR gridw, l. 192: FLOAT removed (number should be integer)
• increase character length of wlabel in SR gridw in grids.f
  to allow full display of all labels
• removal of unused labels (mostly continue)
• deletion of unused variables
• warnings for dummy arguments passed to SRs ignored
• replaced atrim by internal f90 trim, adjustl, and adjustr function
  to allow easy extension of p/T-dependent data
• conversion of ANGCOS from real to 1x1 matrix to avoid
  rank mismatch when called from SR LEPOLY
• rxn_mcm.f: SR r14 (CH3COCHO):
  change wavelength split to '<401' instead of '<402' for IUPAC xs
• rxn_mcm.f: SR r106 and r141 fused using mabs option
  (both describing ethyl nitrate photolysis)
• swchem.f: r106 deleted (now only r141)
• rxn_mcm.f, SR r110: boundaries of parameterisation removed to
  use calculated values as better approximation than zero.

OTHER CHANGES IN CODE:
======================

• switched to non-interactive mode (using switch intrct)
• introduction of parameter 'vers'
  - overwrites individual mabs/myld parameters to enforce either TUV
    or MCM standard datasets for cross sections and quantum yields
  - parameter is set in 'params'
• Addition of new data saved in file rxn_mcm.f (see list below)
• TUV.f renamed to TUV521.f
• rxn.f renamed to rxn_mcm.f
• usrinp: output set IUPAC, several parameters change, additional rxns
• 'MCM4' and 'TUV' added to INPUTS for standard MCM and TUV runs
• Additional reaction pathways for HNO3 and HNO4 photolysis
• New subroutine to interpolate matrix elements of 2D matrix with
  given minimum and maximum values
  -> subroutine intermat added to numer.f
• Loading of photochemical data for organic extension in SR mcmext
• Addition of new subroutines for extended organic chemistry
  - Aldehydes in file rxn_ald.f
• Added comment to TUV main screen to change variable nmj
  to toggle photoreactions on/off
• Changed warning statement if kj is exceeded.
• log file:
  - Renamed to '<outfil>.log'
  - Added choice of input data
• Increased Parameter kt in params to 500
  (used for maximum time steps/sza steps)
  to allow high resolution output data
• Increased Parameter kj in params to 250
  (used for maximum numbers of labels
   to allow for more reactions)
• Increased Parameter kw in params to 1200
  (for use of 0.5 nm resolution of wavelength grid)
• Comment added: subroutine r10 replaced by pxCH2O
• Addition of new rxn in usrinp files
• New usrinp files 'MCM4' and 'TUV' for MCM and TUV standard runs
• Addition of new screen output with number of reactions
  to double check completeness of usrinp
  (printed after call of swchem and mcmext)
• The character size of 'jlabel' has been made variable.
• Rearrangement of SR pxCH2O before obsolete SR r10

CHANGES TO MAKEFILE:
====================
• compile TUV521.f instead of TUV.f
• compile rxn_mcm.f instead of rxn.f
• Additional objects added to Makefile (make_mcm):
  - mcmext.f: loading of organic extension
  - rxn_ald.f: extended aldehyde photochemistry
  - rxn_ket.f: extended ketone photochemistry
  - rxn_dicar.f: extended dicarbonyl photochemistry
  - rxn_nit.f: extended organic nitrate photochemistry
  - rxn_dinit.f: extended organic dinitrate photochemistry
  - rxn_rooh.f: extended organic hydroperoxide photochemistry
  - rxn_mult.f: extended photochemistry of
                organic compounds with multiple chromophores
  - rxn_rad.f: extended Criegee radical photochemistry
• use 'make -f make_mcm' to generate tuvmcm with MCM standard dataset
• run 'tuv' for TUV version and 'tuvmcm' for MCM version
• Addition of -fcheck=all flag to give warnings for "out-of-bounds" array sizes
• new variable 'WFLAG'  with warning options for compilation
  based on -Wall for gfortran

ISSUES:
=======

• SR QGAUSN in rtrans.f, l. 3440:
  'GWT( K ) = sngl(TWO) / ( sngl(TMP)*( sngl(EN)*PM2 )**2 )'
  conversion of PM2 into sngl causes TUV to crash
